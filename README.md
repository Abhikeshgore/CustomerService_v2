* 	Download the zip or clone the Git repository.
* 	Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
* 	Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
* 	Open IntelliJ IDEA
	* File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
	* Select the project
* 	Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
* 	Right Click on the file and Run as Java Application
Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```

Note: Please make sure you have JDK 17 installed on your system as default runtime environment is set to Java 17.
